Qdrant Problem Statement - Convolve 
4.0 - A Pan-IIT AI/ML Hackathon 
Search, Memory, and Recommendations for Societal Impact 
 
01. Motivation 
Modern AI systems increasingly interact with multimodal data - text, 
code, images, audio, video, and structured signals. Societal 
challenges such as healthcare access, climate resilience, education 
equity, and public safety require systems that can reliably search, 
remember, and reason over long-term, evolving 
Knowledge. 
Societal challenges - such as healthcare access, climate resilience, 
public safety, education equity, misinformation detection, and 
accessibility - require systems that can: 
●​ Search across massive, heterogeneous datasets​
 
●​ Maintain long-term memory across time and interactions​
 
●​ Recommend context-aware, personalized, and responsible 
actions​
 
This challenge invites participants to design AI agents or 
applications powered by Qdrant, a high-performance vector search 
engine, to enable reliable retrieval, memory, and reasoning over 
multimodal data - not as a demo, but as a system addressing a 
real-world societal problem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
\n02. About Qdrant 
Qdrant is an open-source, production-grade vector search engine 
designed for high-performance similarity search, filtering, and 
scalable AI workloads. 
Qdrant enables: 
●​ Dense & sparse vector search​
 
●​ Hybrid search (semantic + keyword + metadata filtering)​
 
●​ Multimodal embeddings (text, image, audio, video, code)​
 
●​ Real-time updates and low-latency retrieval​
 
●​ Strong consistency and horizontal scalability​
 
Qdrant is used globally to power: 
●​ AI agents and copilots​
 
●​ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)​
 
●​ Long-term memory systems​
 
●​ Recommendation engines​
 
●​ Multimodal search platforms​

\n03. The Challenge 
Build an AI agent or application that uses Qdrant as a core 
component to power one or more of the following capabilities: 
●​ Search – semantic or hybrid retrieval over multimodal data​
 
●​ Memory – persistent, long-term, or evolving knowledge storage​
 
●​ Recommendations – context-aware suggestions or decision 
support​
 
The system must address a societal challenge, such as (but not 
limited to): 
●​ Healthcare & mental health support​
 
●​ Climate & environmental monitoring​
 
●​ Disaster response & public safety​
 
●​ Education & accessibility​
 
●​ Civic tech & governance​
 
●​ Misinformation & digital trust​
 
●​ Inclusion, assistive technologies, or equity​
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
\n04. System Expectations 
Your solution should clearly demonstrate: 
1. Effective Multimodal Retrieval 
●​ Storing and querying non-text data (images, audio, video, code, 
sensor data, etc.)​
 
●​ Correct use of vector embeddings and similarity search​
 
●​ Meaningful metadata filtering and payload design​
 
2. Memory Beyond a Single Prompt 
●​ Long-term or session-based memory​
 
●​ Evolving representations (updates, deletions, decay, 
reinforcement)​
 
●​ Clear distinction between knowledge, context, and interaction 
history​
 
3. Societal Relevance & Responsibility 
●​ A clearly defined real-world problem​
 
●​ Thoughtful handling of bias, safety, privacy, or explainability​
 
●​ Realistic deployment assumptions​
 
4. Evidence-Based Outputs 
●​ Outputs grounded in retrieved data​
 
\n●​ Traceable reasoning paths (what was retrieved, why, and how it 
influenced decisions)​
 
●​ Avoiding hallucinated or ungrounded responses 
 
 
 
 
 
05. Example Directions 
Participants may explore ideas such as: 
●​ A multimodal disaster-response agent retrieving satellite 
images, emergency audio logs, and text reports​
 
●​ A healthcare memory assistant tracking patient history, 
reports, and medical images over time​
 
●​ An education accessibility system recommending 
personalized learning resources using text, video, and 
interaction data​
 
●​ A misinformation detection engine correlating claims across 
articles, images, and social media snippets​
 
These are examples, not constraints. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
\n06. Technical Requirements 
Mandatory 
●​ Qdrant must be used as the primary vector search engine​
 
●​ Vectors must represent meaningful semantic or multimodal 
signals​
 
●​ Demonstrate search, memory, or recommendation as a 
system capability (not just storage)​
 
Allowed & Encouraged 
●​ Any embedding models (open-source or hosted)​
 
●​ Any LLMs or agent frameworks​
 
●​ Hybrid architectures (symbolic + neural)​
 
●​ Streaming or batch ingestion​
 
●​ Re-ranking, filtering, or feedback loops​
 
Not Required 
●​ Training large models from scratch​
 
●​ Proprietary datasets​
 
●​ UI-heavy implementations (CLI or API is acceptable)​
