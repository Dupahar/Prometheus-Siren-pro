# Conclusion & Future Roadmap

## 🎯 Conclusion
Prometheus-Siren successfully demonstrates the "Cyber-Immune" concept. By coupling **immediate blocking** (Sidecar) with **long-term healing** (Gemini Patching + Vector Memory), it solves the fundamental flaw of static WAFs: they don't evolve.

This system doesn't just block attacks; it effectively **vaccinates** the entire infrastructure against them.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### Short Term (Q2 2026)
- **Rust Relay:** Rewrite the data-plane proxy in Rust for maximum performance.
- **K8s Operator:** Build the MutatingAdmissionWebhook for auto-injection.

### Medium Term (Q4 2026)
- **Multi-Modal Analysis:** Analyze not just text, but binary payloads and image uploads.
- **Deception 2.0:** Use LLMs to dynamically generate honeypot responses (chat with the hacker).

### Long Term (2027+)
- **Autonomous Red Teaming:** The system attacks itself to learn weak spots before hackers do.
- **Hardware Integration:** Offload vector search to FPGA/GPU.
