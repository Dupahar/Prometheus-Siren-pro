# Prometheus-Siren: Introduction

## 🌟 Vision
**"The Self-Evolving Cyber-Immune System"**

Traditional security tools (WAFs, IDS) are static. They rely on manually updated rules, leaving them vulnerable to Zero-Day attacks until a human intervenes. 

**Prometheus-Siren** changes this paradigm. It is an autonomous security system that works like a biological immune system:
1.  **Detects** novel pathogens (attacks) using AI.
2.  **Neutralizes** them instantly with local antibodies (sidecar blocking).
3.  **Learns** and **Evolves** by generating vaccines (patches) and sharing valid immunity across the entire fleet (Global Hive Mind).

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities
- **Zero-False Positive Architecture:** Multi-layered analysis ensures legit traffic flows freely while attacks are routed to honeypots.
- **Autonomous Patching:** Can rewrite its own WAF rules and suggest code-level fixes using GenAI.
- **Microservice-Native:** Designed as a lightweight Kubernetes Sidecar.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Report
This document series details the technical architecture, layer-by-layer data flow, commercial strategy, and performance benchmarks of the system as demonstrated in the Version 2.0 release.
